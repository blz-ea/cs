# Type System #

JavaScript can be categorized as `Non-Strongly Typed`, `Weakly Typed` or `Un-Typed`.
JavaScript behaves according to the definition of being `Typed`. And therefore it must be `Dynamically Typed` and `Weakly Typed`

**Execution context** when a function is called an execution context is created. Context holds function `variables`,`this` and a reference to the `outer environment`.

**Closure** is a "snapshot" of the environment a function is in when it is executed.

**Hoisting** is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.
