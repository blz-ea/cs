# To optimize code by reducing #

- State
- Coupling (dependencies)
- Complexity
- Duplicate Code

- We can increase coupling if it make more stateless
  Stateless are same if we run normally, parallel or distributed
  Easier to test 
  Easiest to scale up 

- We can make it more complex if it reduces coupling
- We can duplicate if it make our code less complex

# Ways of improving performance #
- Vertical - put more performant hardware
- Horizontal - add more compute resources
- Going Deep - getting down closer to the metal, by using more performant  algorithms, thorough planning, profiling
