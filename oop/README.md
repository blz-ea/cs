# OOP #

Programming paradigm based on a concept of `objects` which contain `attributes` and `methods`.

OOP provides code reusability which reduce duplication of code because once you have duplicate code, you have to make changes everywhere which leads to problems with performance

## Features ##

- Abstraction and Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance and Composition

**Polymorphism** - means "many forms" and in programming describes ability for objects to present the same interface for different behaviors, so calling `man.sayHello()` and `women.sayHello()` would result in different output, even though the method call is the same.

**Encapsulation** - is a process of wrapping the data that operates on the data. This keeps data safe from outside interface and misuse.

**Abstraction** - is a methodology of hiding irrelevant details. In other words make complex system simple by hiding unnecessary details from the user and provide functionality that is needed.

**Inheritance** - is a fundamental code reuse mechanism. A way for different kinds of objects to share code.

**Composition** - is principle in OOP that classes should achieve polymorphic behavior and code reuse by their composition.

## Interfaces ##

Broadly speaking an interface consists of any methods and variables that can be accessed outside of the class itself

Real world examples: Keyhole, Shift-stick, Light switch - these are all interfaces that allow me an external consumer to interact with the system behind it.
