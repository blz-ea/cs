# Balanced Binary Tree #

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:

a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

**Example 1:**

Given the following tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]:
```pseudo
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

Return true.

**Example 2:**

Given the following tree [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]:

```pseudo
       1
      / \
     2   2
    / \
   3   3
  / \
 4   4
```
Return false.
