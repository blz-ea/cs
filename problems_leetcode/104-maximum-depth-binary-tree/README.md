# Maximum Depth of Binary Tree #

**Difficulty:** Easy

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`,

```pseudo
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

return its depth = 3.
```
