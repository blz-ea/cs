# Queues #

A queue is a useful data structure in programming. It is similar to the ticket queue outside a cinema hall, where the first person entering the queue is the first person who gets the ticket.

Queue follows the First In First Out(FIFO) rule - the item that goes in first is the item that comes out first too.
### Use cases ###

- Stack:
  - Background tasks
  - Uploading
  - Print queue/Task processing

### Big O ###

- Insertion - O(1)
- Removal - O(1)
- Searching - O(n)
- Access - O(n)

Searching and Access is not important, since stack data type prioritize Insertion and Removal
