# Binary Tree #

Binary Tree is a data structure where each parent can have at most two children

## Binary Tree Applications ##

- Easy and quick access to data
- Router algorithms
- Implement heap data structure
- Syntax Tree (AST)

## Balanced vs Unbalanced ##

Binary Tree is a balanced if absolute value of the height (calculated on each node starting from root and going left and then right) of the tree is <= 1. 

## Full (strict, proper) binary tree ##

Is a tree in which every node other than leaves has two children

## Complete binary tree ##

Is a tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible

## Implementations ##

- [TypeScript](./typescript)
- [Python](./python)
